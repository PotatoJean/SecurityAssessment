<h1>Security Assessment (NIST Cybersecurity Framework)</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

This report is my attempt to apply what I have learned from Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate to create a security assessment report on a mock department of an organization using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. I will not create a full on report with the actual structure since this is for my learning experience purpose only. Do note that an actual report goes into way more detail than what I have done below.</br>
</br>
Goal of Project: To conduct a security assessment using NIST Cybersecurity Framework on a mock SOC department of an organization. 
<br />


<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>NIST Cybersecurity Framework</b> 

<h2>Introduction</h2>


The security assessment is conducted from the point of view of my organization (PJ) to a mock SOC department of X organization. <br/>


I have taken 4 steps to create this report, preparation, assessment questions, evaluation based on maturity levels and reporting. These steps will be explained individually below. <br/>
1) Preparation<br/>
  - Understanding the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and its core functions.<br/>

    </p>
  - Define scope whether department, system,  process or organization.<br/>
2) Questions based on 5 core functions<br/>
  - Assess the current state of the defined scope on its gaps and weaknesses.<br/>
  - Evaluate each core function<br/>

3) Maturity levels<br/>
  - Provide a rating for each section after evaluation.<br/>

    </p>
4) Reporting<br/>
  - Create a summary of assessment carried out.<br/>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
 <p>We can utilise a radar chart to display the summary of the assessment outcome. Since we only accessed one category for each control from the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, we will get a pentagon radar chart. A full assessment radar chart will be a circle with way more categories. </br></p>

<br />
    <p>From this radar chart above, we can tell that the SOC department from X organisation is lacking in 4 out of 5 controls. An organization can use this as a guidance together with the recommendations given by the security personnel to improve their security posture.</p>

<p>That's all for this mock security assessment, thanks for reading this far. I have removed executive summary and stakeholder interviewed sections to keep this short. If you are interested in Google Docs version of this write-up, check out the link below </br></p>
